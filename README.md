# Decentralized Community Solar Project Management

A blockchain-based system for transparent, collaborative management of community solar installations through shared investment, production monitoring, and equitable benefit distribution.

## Core Components

### Installation Verification Contract
- Validates solar equipment specifications and installed capacity
- Records technical parameters and performance expectations
- Creates immutable documentation of system components
- Establishes baseline for production monitoring

### Participant Management Contract
- Tracks individual community member investments
- Manages ownership shares based on contribution levels
- Enables transferable participation rights
- Maintains registry of current stakeholders

### Energy Production Contract
- Monitors real-time electricity generated by the solar system
- Creates verifiable record of production data
- Integrates with monitoring hardware for automated reporting
- Identifies and flags performance anomalies

### Benefit Distribution Contract
- Allocates energy credits proportional to ownership share
- Manages utility bill offsets for participants
- Handles financial settlements for excess production
- Creates transparent accounting of all distributed benefits

## System Benefits

- **Democratized Access**: Enables participation regardless of property ownership
- **Investment Transparency**: Provides clear visibility into project finances
- **Performance Accountability**: Creates verifiable production monitoring
- **Equitable Distribution**: Ensures fair allocation of generated benefits
- **Community Empowerment**: Builds local energy independence and resilience
